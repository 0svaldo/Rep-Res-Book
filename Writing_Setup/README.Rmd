The files in this repository comprise the draft version of **Reproducible Research with R and RStudio**.

### File Organization

The main files used to create the manuscript of the book are in the `/Source` folder. This folder contains the parent *knitr* `.Rnw` file in the `/Source/Parent/` directory. Child documents for the book chapters are in the `/Source/Children/` directory and child files for the book's frontmatter are in the `/Source/FrontMatter/` directory.

### Reproduce the Book

The book can be reproduced by using the R package *knitr*. To do this:

1. Make sure you have [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html) installed on your computer.

2. Open the file *BookMake.R*. Change the directories for `ParentDirectory` and `SetUpDirectory` to directory you have the files *Rep-Res-Parent.Rnw* and *README.Rmd* located in.

3. Run the *BookMake.R* make file in R. Note: you must install the *knitr* R package before running this file.

Note: To install the R packages used to compile the book open the *Source/Children/FrontMatter/Packages.Rnw*. Find:

```
doInstall <- FALSE
```

in the code chunk labeled "FrontPackageCitations". Change the value `FALSE` to `TRUE` and run the code chunk
