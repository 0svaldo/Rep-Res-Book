The files in this repository comprise the draft version of **Reproducible Research with R and RStudio**.

### File Organization

The main files used to create the manuscript of the book are in the `/Source` folder. This folder contains the parent *knitr* `.Rnw` file in the `/Source/Parent/` directory. Child documents for the book chapters are in the `/Source/Children/` directory and child files for the book's frontmatter are in the `/Source/FrontMatter/` directory.

### Reproduce the Book

The book can be reproduced by using the R package *knitr*. To do this:

1. Make sure you have [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html) installed on your computer.

2. If you are reproducing the book on a Linux or Mac OS X computer place the repository in a folder in your computer's root directory called `/git_repositories/`. If you are using a Windows computer you will need to make more extensive changes to the directory names thoughougt the markup files.

3. Run the `BookMake.R` make file.

Note: To install the R packages used to compile the book open the Source/FrontMatter/Packages.Rnw. Find:

```
doInstall <- FALSE
```

in the code chunk labeled "FrontPackageCitations". Change the value `FALSE` to `TRUE` and run the code chunk
