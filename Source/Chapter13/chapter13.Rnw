\chapter{Chapter 13: Presenting on the Web and Beyond with Markdown/HTML}

\section{The Basics}

\subsection{Headings}

Headings in Markdown are extremely simple. To create a line in the style
of the topmost heading--maybe a title--just place one hash mark
(\texttt{\#}) at the beginning of the line. The second tier heading just
gets two hashes (\texttt{\#\#}) and so on. You can also put the hash
mark(s) at the end of the heading, but this is not necessary.
