\chapter{Chapter 6: Storing, Versioning, Collaborating, and Accessing Files}

A stumbling block to actually reproducing a piece of research is getting a hold of the datasets and the codebooks that describe the data used in an analysis. <!-- Complete -->

Researchers often face a number of data management issues that, beyond making their research difficult to reproduce, can make doing the initial research difficult.

First, there is the problem of **storing** the data so that it is protected against computer failure--virus infections, dropping your laptop on the floor, and so on. 

Second, when 


 the data set can often grow and become disorganized. Perhaps even during a data transformation  This creates problems  
 
You can solve all of these problems in a couple of different ways using free or low cost cloud-based storage formats. In this chapter we will learn how to use **Dropbox** and **GitHub** for data:

- storage,

- version control,

- accessing, 

- and collaboration.

# Saving data in reproducible formats

Before getting into the details of cloud-based data storage, lets just consider what type of formats you should actually save your data in. A key issue for reproducibility is that others be able to not only get ahold of the exact data you used in your analysis, but be able to understand and use the data not only now, but in the future. Some file formats make this easier than others.

**R** is able to read (and write) a very wide variety of file formats, mostly through the `foreign` package in `base` **R**. This includes

# Dropbox

Probably the easiest types of cloud storage for your research are services like **Dropbox** and **Google Drive**. I am going to focus on using **Dropbox** because it currently offers a complete set of features that allow you to store, version, collaborate, and access your data.
