%% Stylistic Conventions for Reproducible Research with R and RStudio

I use the following conventions throughout this book:

- **Abstract Variables**

Abstract variables, i.e. variables that do not represent specific objects in an example, are in `ALL CAPS TYPEWRITER TEXT`. 

- **Clickable Buttons**

Clickable Buttons are in `typewriter text`. 

- **Code** 

All code is in `typewriter text`.

- **Filenames and Directories**

Filenames and directories more generally are printed in *italics*. I use CamelBack for file and directory names.

- **File extensions**

Like filenames, file extensions are *italicized*.

- **Individual variable values**

Individual variable values mentioned in the text are in *italics*.

- **Objects**

Objects are printed in *italics*. I use CamelBack for object names.

- **Object Columns**

Data frame object columns are printed in *italics*.


- **Packages**

**R** packages are printed in *italics*.

- **Windows an RStudio Panes**

Open windows and RStudio panes are written in *italics*.

- **Variable Names**

Variable names are printed in **bold**. I use CamelBack for individual variable names.
