\chapter{Preparing Data for Analysis}\label{DataClean}

\todo[inline]{This chapter is incomplete.}

Once we have gathered the raw data that we want to include in our statistical analyses we generally need to clean it and merge it into a single data file. This chapter covers some of the basics of how to clean data files and merge them together into one data frame using R.
