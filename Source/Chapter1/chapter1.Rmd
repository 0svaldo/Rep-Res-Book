# Why use R/RStudio for reproducible research?



# What this book is not. 

This book describes a workflow for reproducible research primarily using **R** and **RStudio**. It is designed to give you the necessary tools to use this workflow for your own research. It is not designed to be a complete introduction to **R**, **RStudio**, **GitHub**, the command line, or any other program that is part of this workflow. Instead it is shows you how these tools can fit together to make you research more reproducible.

To get the most out of these individual programs I point you to other resources that cover these programs in more detail. 

That being said, my goal in this for this book to be self-sufficient to the extent that a reader without a detailed understanding of these programs will be able to understand and use the commands and procedures I cover in this book. While learning how to use **R** and the other programs I often encountered examples that included commands, variables, and other things that were not well explained in the texts that I was reading. This lead to many wasted hours trying to figure out, for example, what the `$` in **R** is used for. I hope to save you from this wasted time by either providing a brief explanation of these possibly frustratingly mysterious conventions and/or pointing you in the direction of a good explanation. 


# Book overview

## How to read this book.

This book tells a story. It has a beginning, middle, and end. So, unlike a reference book it can and should be read like a novel, taking you through an empirical research processes from an empty folder maybe called `Research Paper` to a completed set of documents that showcase your findings.

That being said, readers with more experience using tools like **R** or \\( \LaTeX \\) may want to skip over the nitty-gritty parts of the book that describe how to manipulate data frames or compile a \\( \LaTeX \\) document into a PDF. Please feel free to do this. 

If you are experienced with **R** in particular you may want to skip over Chapter 3: Getting Started with **R**/**RStudio**.

## How this book was written

This book practices what it preaches. It can be reproduced. It was written using the programs and methods that it describes. Full documentation and source files can be found at the Book's **GitHub** repository. 

Feel free to read and even copy (within reason and with attribution, of course) the Book's source code. You can find it at <https://github.com/christophergandrud/Rep-Res-Book>. This is especially useful if you want to know how to do something in the book that I don't directly cover in the text. 

In the same spirit, I encourage you to make your research files--not just data, but analysis code and markup--available for other researchers to learn from. 

Not only does reproducibility help us evaluate past work, but it also pushes forward knowledge in the scientific community.
