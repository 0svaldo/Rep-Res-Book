This book would not have been possible without the advice and support of a great many people.


The **R** developer and blogging community has been incredibly important for making this book possible. Foremost among among these people is Yihui Xie. He is the developer of the `knitr` package (among others) and also an avid writer and reader of blogs. Without him the ability to do reproducible research would be much harder and the blogging community that spreads knowledge about how to do these things would be poorer. 

Other important bloggers include Carl Boettiger (who also developed the `knitcitations` package), Markus Gesmann, Jeromy Anglim

The vibrant and very helpful community at Stack Overflow <http://stackoverflow.com/> is always very helpful for finding answers to small problems that plague any coder. Importantly it makes it easy for others to find these answers.
